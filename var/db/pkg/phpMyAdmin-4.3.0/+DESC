tool to handle the administration of MySQL over the web
phpMyAdmin can manage a whole MySQL server (needs a super-user) as
well as a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need a
properly set up MySQL user who can read/write only the desired database.
It's up to you to look up the appropriate part in the MySQL manual.
